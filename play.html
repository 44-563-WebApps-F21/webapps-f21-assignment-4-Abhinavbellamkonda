        entering_. _Door L.U. opens on to illuminated terrace_. _Palms_,

        <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6> <p class="speechparagraph"> So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
                Mr. Hopper is very late, too. You have kept those five dances for him,
                Agatha? </p>

                <h6 class="LADYAGATHA"><b>LADY AGATHA.</b></h6> <p>?Yes, mamma.</p><br>

                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK"><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6>  <p class="speechparagraph">Just let me see your card.
                I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
                safeguard. You dear simple little thing! No nice girl should ever waltz 
                with such particularly younger sons! I looks so fast! The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
                Mr. Hopper.</p>

                the last ball of the season?.</p><br>
               
                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK"><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph"> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It has been a very dull

                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK."><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph"> Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.
                We all know how you are run after in London.</p><br>

                <h6 class="HOPPER"><b> HOPPER.</b></h6> <p class="speechparagraph">Capital place, London! They are not nearly so exclusive in
                London as they are in Sydney.</p><br>

                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK"><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6> <p class="speechparagraph">Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper. We wish there
                were more like you. It would make life so much easier. Do you know, Mr.
                Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia. It must
                be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about. Agatha has
                found it on the map. What a curious shape it is! Just like a large
                packing case. However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?</p><br>

                <h6 class="HOPPER"><b>HOPPER.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph"> Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?</p>

                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK"><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph"> How clever you are, Mr. Hopper. You have a
                cleverness quite of your own. Now I mustn’t keep you.<br>But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.</p><br>

                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK"><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph">Well, I hope she has a dance left. Have you a dance
                left, Agatha?</p><br>

                <h6 class="LADYAGATHA"><b>LADY AGATHA.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph"> Yes, mamma.</p><br>

                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK"></h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6> <p class="speechparagraph">The next one?</p><br>

                <h6 class="LADYAGATHA"><b>LADY AGATHA.</b></h6> <p class="speechparagraph">Yes, mamma.</p><br>

                <h6 class="HOPPER"><b>HOPPER.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph"> May I have the pleasure? </p>
                  <p class="stageDirectionparagraph">[LADY AGATHA _bows_.]</p><br>

                <h6 class="DUCHESSOFBERWICK"><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p class="speechparagraph"> Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox,
                Mr. Hopper.</p><br>
