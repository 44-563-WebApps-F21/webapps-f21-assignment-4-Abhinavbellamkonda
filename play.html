        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> [_Up C._] So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
                Mr. Hopper is very late, too. You have kept those five dances for him,
                Agatha? [_Comes down_.]<br>

                <b>LADY AGATHA.?</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> [_Sitting on sofa_.] Just let me see your card.
                I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
                safeguard. You dear simple little thing! [_Scratches out two names_.]
                No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons! It
                looks so fast! The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
                Mr. Hopper.<br>

                [_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]<br>

                <b>LADY AGATHA.</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

                <b> DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> [_Fanning herself_.] The air is so pleasant there.<br>

                <b> Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.</b> Lady Stutfield. Sir James Royston. Mr.
                Guy Berkeley.<br>

                [_These people enter as announced_.]<br>

                Good evening, Lady Stutfield. I suppose this will be the last
                ball of the season?<br>

                <b> STUTFIELD.</b> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It’s been a delightful season,
                hasn’t it?<br>

                Quite delightful! Good evening, Duchess. I suppose this will be
                the last ball of the season?<br>

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It has been a very dull
                season, hasn’t it?<br>

                <b>DUMBY.</b> Dreadfully dull! Dreadfully dull!<br>

                <b>MR. COWPER-COWPER.</b> Good evening, Mr. Dumby. I suppose this will be the
                last ball of the season?<br>

                <b>DUMBY.</b> Oh, I think not. There’ll probably be two more. [_Wanders back
                to_ LADY PLYMDALE.]<br>

                <b>PARKER.</b> Mr. Rufford. Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham. Mr. Hopper.<br>

                [_These people enter as announced_.]<br>

                <b>HOPPER.</b> How do you do, Lady Windermere? How do you do, Duchess? [_Bows
                to_ LADY AGATHA.]<br>

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.
                We all know how you are run after in London.<br>

                <b> HOPPER.</b> Capital place, London! They are not nearly so exclusive in
                London as they are in Sydney.<br>

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper. We wish there
                were more like you. It would make life so much easier. Do you know, Mr.
                Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia. It must
                be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about. Agatha has
                found it on the map. What a curious shape it is! Just like a large
                packing case. However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?<br>

                <b>HOPPER.</b> Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> How clever you are, Mr. Hopper. You have a
                cleverness quite of your own. Now I mustn’t keep you.<br>

                But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.<br>

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b>Well, I hope she has a dance left. Have you a dance
                left, Agatha?<br>

                <b>LADY AGATHA.</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> The next one?<br>

                <b>LADY AGATHA.</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

                <b>HOPPER.</b> May I have the pleasure? [LADY AGATHA _bows_.]<br>

                <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox,
                Mr. Hopper.<br>

        me into the ball-room?
        Augustus has been dining with us to-night. I really have had quite enough of dear Augustus for the moment.Dear
        Margaret, I’ve just been having such a
        delightful chat with Mrs. Erlynne. I am so sorry for what I said to you this afternoon about her. Of course, she
        must be all right if _you_invite her. A most attractive woman, and has such sensible views on
        life. Told me she entirely disapproved of people marrying more than once, so I feel quite safe about poor
        Augustus. Can’t imagine why people
        speak against her. It’s those horrid nieces of mine—the Saville girls—they’re always talking scandal. Still, I
        should go to Homburg,
        dear, I really should. She is just a little too attractive. But where is Agatha? Oh, there she is: Mr. Hopper, I
        am very, very angry with you. You have taken Agatha out on the terrace, and she
        is so delicate.
        Ah, about dear Australia, I suppose?HOPPER. Yes!Agatha, darling! Did Mr. Hopper definitely— LADY AGATHA. Yes,
        mamma.
        And what answer did you give him, dear child?My dear one! You always say the right thing. Mr. Hopper! James!
        Agatha has told me everything.
        How cleverly you have both kept your secret.To Australia? Oh, don’t mention that dreadful vulgar place.Did you
        say that, Agatha?
        Agatha, you say the most silly things possible. I think on the whole that Grosvenor Square would be a more
        healthy place to reside in. There are lots of vulgar people live in Grosvenor Square, but
        at any rate there are no horrid kangaroos crawling about. But we’ll talk about that to-morrow. James, you can
        take Agatha down. You’ll come to
        lunch, of course, James. At half-past one, instead of two. The Duke will wish to say a few words to you, I am
        sure.
        I think you’ll find he will have a great deal to say
        to you to-morrow. And now good-night, Margaret. I’m afraid it’s the old,
        old story, dear.
        Love—well, not love at first sight, but love at the end of the season,which is so much more satisfactory.
