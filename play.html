    <p>_Drawing-room in Lord Windermere’s house_. _Door R.U. opening into
        ball-room_, _where band is playing_. _Door L. through which guests are
        entering_. _Door L.U. opens on to illuminated terrace_. _Palms_,
        _flowers_, _and brilliant lights_. _Room crowded with guests_. _Lady
        Windermere is receiving them_.<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.<b> [_Up C._] So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
        Mr. Hopper is very late, too. You have kept those five dances for him,
        Agatha? [_Comes down_.]<br>

        <b>LADY AGATHA.?</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> [_Sitting on sofa_.] Just let me see your card.
        I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
        safeguard. You dear simple little thing! [_Scratches out two names_.]
        No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons! It
        looks so fast! The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
        Mr. Hopper.<br>

        [_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]<br>

        <b>LADY AGATHA.</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

       <b> DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> [_Fanning herself_.] The air is so pleasant there.<br>

        <b> Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.</b> Lady Stutfield. Sir James Royston. Mr.
        Guy Berkeley.<br>

        [_These people enter as announced_.]<br>

        Good evening, Lady Stutfield. I suppose this will be the last
        ball of the season?<br>

        <b> STUTFIELD.</b> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It’s been a delightful season,
        hasn’t it?<br>

         Quite delightful! Good evening, Duchess. I suppose this will be
        the last ball of the season?<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It has been a very dull
        season, hasn’t it?<br>

        <b>DUMBY.</b> Dreadfully dull! Dreadfully dull!<br>

        <b>MR. COWPER-COWPER.</b> Good evening, Mr. Dumby. I suppose this will be the
        last ball of the season?<br>

        <b>DUMBY.</b> Oh, I think not. There’ll probably be two more. [_Wanders back
        to_ LADY PLYMDALE.]<br>

        <b>PARKER.</b> Mr. Rufford. Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham. Mr. Hopper.<br>

        [_These people enter as announced_.]<br>

        <b>HOPPER.</b> How do you do, Lady Windermere? How do you do, Duchess? [_Bows
        to_ LADY AGATHA.]<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.
        We all know how you are run after in London.<br>

       <b> HOPPER.</b> Capital place, London! They are not nearly so exclusive in
        London as they are in Sydney.<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper. We wish there
        were more like you. It would make life so much easier. Do you know, Mr.
        Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia. It must
        be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about. Agatha has
        found it on the map. What a curious shape it is! Just like a large
        packing case. However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?<br>

        <b>HOPPER.</b> Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> How clever you are, Mr. Hopper. You have a
        cleverness quite of your own. Now I mustn’t keep you.<br>

         But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b>> Well, I hope she has a dance left. Have you a dance
        left, Agatha?<br>

        <b>LADY AGATHA.</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b> The next one?<br>

        <b>LADY AGATHA.</b> Yes, mamma.<br>

        <b>HOPPER.</b> May I have the pleasure? [LADY AGATHA _bows_.]<br>

        <b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b>> Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox,
        Mr. Hopper.<br></p>
