    <h1>Produced By Abhinav Bellamkonda</h1>
    <p>_Drawing-room in Lord Windermere’s house_. _Door R.U. opening into
        ball-room_, _where band is playing_. _Door L. through which guests are
        entering_. _Door L.U. opens on to illuminated terrace_. _Palms_,
        _flowers_, _and brilliant lights_. _Room crowded with guests_. _Lady
        Windermere is receiving them_.<br>

        <h6 ><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6>  So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
                Mr. Hopper is very late, too. You have kept those five dances for him,
                Agatha? [_Comes down_.]
                <p>[_Up C._]</p>
                <br>

                <h6><b>LADY AGATHA.</b></h6> <p>?Yes, mamma.</p><br>

                <h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6>  <p>Just let me see your card.
                I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
                safeguard. You dear simple little thing! No nice girl should ever waltz 
                with such particularly younger sons! I looks so fast! The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
                Mr. Hopper.
                <p> [_Sitting on sofa_.][_Scratches out two names_.]
                [_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]</p><br>

                <h6><b>LADY AGATHA.</b></h6><p> Yes, mamma.</p><br>

                <h6><b> DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p>The air is so pleasant there.</p><br>
                <p>[_Fanning herself_.]</p>
                <h6><b> Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.</b></h6><p> Lady Stutfield. Sir James Royston. Mr.
                Guy Berkeley.>Good evening, Lady Stutfield. I suppose this will be the last
                ball of the season?</p><br>

               <p> [_These people enter as announced_.]</p><br>

                <h6><b> STUTFIELD.</b></h6><p> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It’s been a delightful season,
                hasn’t it? <br>Quite delightful! Good evening, Duchess. I suppose this will be
                the last ball of the season?.</p><br>

                
                <h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It has been a very dull
                season, hasn’t it?</p><br>

                <h6><b>DUMBY.</b></h6><p> Dreadfully dull! Dreadfully dull!</p><br>

                <h6><b>MR. COWPER-COWPER.</b></h6><p> Good evening, Mr. Dumby. I suppose this will be the
                last ball of the season?</p><br>

                <h6><b>DUMBY.</b></h6><p> Oh, I think not. There’ll probably be two more.</p> 
                <p>[_Wanders back to_ LADY PLYMDALE.]</p><br>

                <h6><b>PARKER.</b></h6><p> Mr. Rufford. Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham. Mr. Hopper.</p><br>

                <p>[_These people enter as announced_.]</p><br>

                <h6><b>HOPPER.</b></h6><p> How do you do, Lady Windermere? How do you do, Duchess?</p>
                 <p>[_Bows to_ LADY AGATHA.]</p><br>

                <h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p> Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.
                We all know how you are run after in London.</p><br>

                <h6><b> HOPPER.</b></h6> <p>Capital place, London! They are not nearly so exclusive in
                London as they are in Sydney.</p><br>

                <h6>.<b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6> <p>Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper. We wish there
                were more like you. It would make life so much easier. Do you know, Mr.
                Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia. It must
                be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about. Agatha has
                found it on the map. What a curious shape it is! Just like a large
                packing case. However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?</p><br>

                <h6><b>HOPPER.</b></h6><p> Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?</p>

                <h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p> How clever you are, Mr. Hopper. You have a
                cleverness quite of your own. Now I mustn’t keep you.<br>But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.</p><br>


                <h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p>Well, I hope she has a dance left. Have you a dance
                left, Agatha?</p><br>

                <h6><b>LADY AGATHA.</b></h6><p> Yes, mamma.</p><br>

                <h6></h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6> <p>The next one?</p><br>

                <h6><b>LADY AGATHA.</b></h6> <p>Yes, mamma.</p><br>

                <h6><b>HOPPER.</b></h6><p> May I have the pleasure? </p>
                  <p>[LADY AGATHA _bows_.]</p><br>

                <h6><b>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</b></h6><p> Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox,
                Mr. Hopper.</p><br>
