    <h1>Produced By Abhinav Bellamkonda</h1>
    <p>_Drawing-room in Lord Windermere’s house_.  _Door R.U. opening into
        ball-room_, _where band is playing_.  _Door L. through which guests are
        entering_.  _Door L.U. opens on to illuminated terrace_.  _Palms_,
        _flowers_, _and brilliant lights_.  _Room crowded with guests_.  _Lady
        Windermere is receiving them_.<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Up C._]  So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
        Mr. Hopper is very late, too.  You have kept those five dances for him,
        Agatha?  [_Comes down_.]<br>
        
        LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Sitting on sofa_.]  Just let me see your card.
        I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
        safeguard.  You dear simple little thing!  [_Scratches out two names_.]
        No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons!  It
        looks so fast!  The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
        Mr. Hopper.<br>
        
        [_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]<br>
        
        LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Fanning herself_.]  The air is so pleasant there.<br>
        
        PARKER.  Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.  Lady Stutfield.  Sir James Royston.  Mr.
        Guy Berkeley.<br>
        
        [_These people enter as announced_.]<br>
        
        DUMBY.  Good evening, Lady Stutfield.  I suppose this will be the last
        ball of the season?<br>
        
        LADY STUTFIELD.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It’s been a delightful season,
        hasn’t it?<br>
        
        DUMBY.  Quite delightful!  Good evening, Duchess.  I suppose this will be
        the last ball of the season?<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It has been a very dull
        season, hasn’t it?<br>
        
        DUMBY.  Dreadfully dull!  Dreadfully dull!<br>
        
        MR. COWPER-COWPER.  Good evening, Mr. Dumby.  I suppose this will be the
        last ball of the season?<br>
        
        DUMBY.  Oh, I think not.  There’ll probably be two more.  [_Wanders back
        to_ LADY PLYMDALE.]<br>
        
        PARKER.  Mr. Rufford.  Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham.  Mr. Hopper.<br>
        
        [_These people enter as announced_.]<br>
        
        HOPPER.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?  How do you do, Duchess?  [_Bows
        to_ LADY AGATHA.]<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.
        We all know how you are run after in London.<br>
        
        HOPPER.  Capital place, London!  They are not nearly so exclusive in
        London as they are in Sydney.<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper.  We wish there
        were more like you.  It would make life so much easier.  Do you know, Mr.
        Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia.  It must
        be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about.  Agatha has
        found it on the map.  What a curious shape it is!  Just like a large
        packing case.  However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?<br>
        
        HOPPER.  Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  How clever you are, Mr. Hopper.  You have a
        cleverness quite of your own.  Now I mustn’t keep you.<br>
        
        HOPPER.  But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Well, I hope she has a dance left.  Have you a dance
        left, Agatha?<br>
        
        LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  The next one?<br>
        
        LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.<br>
        
        HOPPER.  May I have the pleasure?  [LADY AGATHA _bows_.]<br>
        
        DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox,
        Mr. Hopper.<br></p>
